remote control for bedroom door
If you don't live in a wheelchair you are asking "Why?".  I do live in a wheelchair and must open and close the bedroom door several times a day.
This solution is essentially a 2 wheel remote control car.  Forward and reverse, IR and webserver controlled, could made automatic with a presence sensor, over spin protection provided by a IR  proximity sensor.
